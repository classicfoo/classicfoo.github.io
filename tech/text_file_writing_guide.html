    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a guide to writing reports, essays, articles and guides in a consistent style in a simple text editor like Notepad. What the software lacks in features the person makes up for in discipline.</p>
    <h2>Titles And Headings</h2>
    <p>Start the text file with the name of the document and add some metadata such as author, created date and / or last updated date, etc. Within the main title and headings, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/477836/using-capital-case-on-every-word-of-a-title">capitalize the first letter of every word</a>. This is a simple style that is unambiguous and is a pattern that is easy to understand and generate using an algorithm. You may think that writing headings in “all caps” is a good idea, but in this style guide, it is not recommended as all caps is also a way to communicate shouting, so avoid doing this to prevent confusion and set a more professional style. You may as well also use markdown for the headings as you are writing to save you from going back and formatting the text file into</p>
    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Each paragraph has a heading and each paragraph ends in a blank line. Do not emphasise words like you would in markdown by adorning text with * or capitalizing letters. What I mean is the equivalent of making the words bold, italic or underline. Instead, use emotive language and punctuation to make an impact. <a href="" title="https://leffcommunications.com/2017/03/10/how-to-use-quotation-marks/#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20quotation%20marks,something%2C%20use%20boldface%20or%20italics.">The strength of your words should make any formatting unnecessary</a>.</p>
    <h2>Column Widths</h2>
    <p>BBSs are dead and so should 80 column widths. What I mean is, when reaching a certain width pressing enter to start writing on a new line. We now live in an age where we expect files to work on all devices of all different screen sizes from small mobile phone screens, to medium sized tablet screens, to large flat PC monitors. So just stop doing that please and just use word wrap. Turn on word wrap and resize the window to something that suits you. Even most terminals these days run in a window that can be resized.</p>
    <h2>The problem with date created</h2>
    <p>If you put create a zip file and then extract the contents, it is actually recreated. So what you actually mean when you say date created is when the author wrote the file. The date created column is also not shown in explorer.exe by default. Users have to know to set the column so that it is visible. Users quite often find date modified to be more useful than date created as it aligns with what they were doing most recently.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Use pandoc style links so in future can be more easily published to HTML. In order not to clutter the content in the text file with long links wrap a few words or short sentence with square brackets. Then reference the link underneath the paragraph.</p>
    <p>E.g.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph with a [link].</p>
    <p>[link]: example.com</p>
    <p>This is the start of a new paragraph.</p>
    <a href="../index.html">Back</a>
